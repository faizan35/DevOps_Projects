# Configuration Management with Ansible

Exploring Ansible for configuration management and automation tasks on remote servers.

## Description

This project focuses on utilizing Ansible to automate configuration management tasks across multiple servers. Ansible provides a simple yet powerful approach to managing software packages, files, and services, allowing for efficient provisioning and maintenance of server environments.

## Project Breakdown

1.  **Introduction to Ansible**: Understand the basics of Ansible and its architecture.
2.  **Writing Ansible Playbooks**: Create playbooks to perform various configuration tasks such as installing packages, managing files, and restarting services.
3.  **Exploring Ansible Modules**: Explore Ansible modules for different tasks and understand their usage.
4.  **Advanced Ansible Concepts**: Dive into advanced Ansible concepts including roles, variables, and conditionals to organize and enhance playbook functionality.
5.  **Testing and Deployment**: Test playbooks in different environments and deploy them to production servers.
6.  **Monitoring and Reporting**: Implement monitoring and reporting mechanisms to track playbook execution and server configuration changes.

## Tools Used

- Ansible
- SSH

## Tasks

1.  Install Ansible on the control node.
2.  Set up SSH connectivity between the control node and managed servers.
3.  Write Ansible playbooks to perform basic tasks such as installing packages and managing files.
4.  Explore Ansible roles for organizing playbook tasks into reusable components.
5.  Define variables and use conditionals in playbooks to handle different scenarios.
6.  Test playbooks on staging servers to ensure proper functionality.
7.  Implement error handling and logging in Ansible playbooks.
8.  Monitor playbook execution and server configurations using Ansible Tower or other monitoring tools.
9.  Continuously improve and optimize Ansible playbooks based on feedback and changing requirements.

## Additional Notes

- Maintain version control for Ansible playbooks using Git.
- Regularly update and patch server configurations using Ansible automation.
- Document playbook usage and best practices for team collaboration and knowledge sharing.
